# Anomalies-Detection-in-financial-Transactions

Overview
This project focuses on detecting unusual patterns in financial transactions, a crucial aspect for identifying potential fraud or errors in financial systems. The analysis is performed using a combination of SQL and Python within Jupyter Notebook, with machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Logistic Regression.

Project Components
1. Languages Used
SQL: Utilized for querying and processing data, especially if financial datasets were stored in a relational database.
Python: Employed for data manipulation, visualization, and implementing machine learning algorithms.
2. Datasets
Datasets were imported from Kaggle, a popular platform for data science competitions and datasets.
3. Machine Learning Algorithms
Support Vector Machines (SVM): Leveraged for its ability to handle non-linear relationships, making it effective for separating normal from anomalous financial transactions.
Logistic Regression: A well-known algorithm for binary classification, applied for anomaly detection.
4. Jupyter Notebook
The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, an interactive computing environment ideal for data science projects, allowing for live code, visualizations, and narrative text.

Project Workflow
Data Import: Financial datasets were imported from Kaggle, with SQL used for querying if stored in a relational database.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The data underwent cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and prepare it for machine learning.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for visual exploration and understanding of financial data patterns.
Anomaly Detection with SVM and Logistic Regression: Implemented machine learning algorithms to identify unusual patterns or anomalies in financial transactions.
Model Evaluation: Performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score were employed to assess the effectiveness of the models.
Visualization: Results and findings were visually communicated to enhance understanding.
